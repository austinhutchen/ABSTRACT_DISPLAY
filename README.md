<h1><b> PROJECT ABSTRACT </b></h1>
<p>A display abstraction library I use to interface with various different GPIO pins on the raspbery pi, arduino, and ESP32. Designed to support as many different displays as possible with minimal code refactoring.</p>


<h1> <b> TOOLING CHOICES</b></h1>
<p> I used C for this library to maximize performance and portability on low-memory systems with limited interfacing capability beyond the bit-level source code and an i2c throughput. </p>
